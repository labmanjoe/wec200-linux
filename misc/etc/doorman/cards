##          Card Number
##
## The facility code is only encoded with 8 bits on the card,
##    but for some reason the reader spits out all the extra zeroes.
##    The facility code is not usually stamped on the card directly,
##    but often another number which effectively maps to the facility
##    code is printed on the card.   There are only a few facility codes
##    that the building uses.
## 
## The card number is encoded with 16 bits on the card (values up to
##    65535), so there are no extra digits for the card number.
##    The card number is often printed on the card as 
##    a 5 digit 0-prefixed number.  In some cases the 5 digit printed
##    number is not the actual number for the cards; in this case we
##    usually pre-scan the cards and note the printed number in
##    commented-out card entries in this file

##    /etc/doorman/cards.itlab
##
## The next security level is the 5th and 6th floor server rooms.
## These are accessible by people whose cards are listed in the files
##    /etc/doorman/cards.itlab   AND
##    /etc/doorman/cards.server
##
## The last security level is the general entry doors group.   The
